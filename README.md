  JEE College Predictor

A full-stack web application that predicts possible colleges based on **JEE Main ranks**, **cutoff data**, **category**, and **branch preferences**.  
Built to help students easily estimate their college admission possibilities using real-time data and intelligent filters.

Overview
Users can input their **JEE rank, category, home state, and preferred branch**, and the app predicts the most likely colleges and courses available for admission.  
It matches the studentâ€™s data with historical cutoffs and JoSAA data to produce accurate predictions.

 Key Features
- Rank-based prediction using cutoff data  
- Filter results by state, branch, and institute type  
- Secure user authentication (JWT + bcrypt)  
- Real-time data integration from backend  
- Responsive and user-friendly UI  

 Tech Stack
Frontend:HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
Database: MongoDB  
Authentication: JWT, bcrypt  
Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code, GitHub  

My Role
As a **Full-Stack Developer**, I:
- Developed backend APIs using Node.js & Express  
- Created MongoDB schemas for colleges, cutoffs, and users  
- Implemented the prediction logic for rankâ€“cutoff matching  
- Secured login and signup with JWT and bcrypt  
- Collaborated with the frontend team for smooth integration  

 How It Works
1. User enters JEE rank and preferences  
2. Backend validates input  
3. Logic compares rank with cutoff data in MongoDB  
4. Predictions are filtered by category and state  
5. Results displayed on frontend in a sortable table  


 Learning Outcomes
- Backend API design and database modeling  
- Data-driven prediction systems  
- Authentication and security best practices  
- Full-stack integration and teamwork
